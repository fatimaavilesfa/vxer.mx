# Our Services

## Fun security dev training for Startups

### Pentesting
* Starting this process we first hack into the site
* After we hack the site we explain step by step how we did it
* At the end of this process we show your team the vulnerabilities and how to fix them

### Training
* At the beginning of this process we prepare a list of fun activities/games that focus on offense and defense security
* Then you can choose to either do the activities through video call or by us going straight to your office
* Once there we will explain how to play the games and how everything is going to work and then we begin
* At the end of this process your devs would have had fun and learned to keep your company safe.

## Examples of some of our games

| Name         | Basis             | Goal |
| Cops and Robbers| There is a vault. Robbers try to open it and police try to protect it | Whoever stays with the money wins  |
| Capture the Flag | There are flags hidden and protected   | Whichever team has the most flags of their color win  |


>IMPORTANT NOTE: All of these games are done on computers and are solved with code.

Thank you for your time and attention!
